# Package **xp-ratatui** Notes (README)


**TLDR**: ratatui isn't worth it for me.
For simple things I'll just draw and clear screen.
For more complicated things I'd rather spend my time learning egui.
(Really appreciate the tutorials though.)

However, if there ever is a need there are some [Templates](https://ratatui.rs/templates/) that could make matters reasonably productive (skipping some of the boilerplate setup).
(Note: there are more templates in the repo than are listed in the docs at the time of this writing.)
